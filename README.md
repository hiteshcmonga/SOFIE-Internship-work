## Running Owner.js

- Clone the repo.
- For owner code, run ```owner.js``` in vc_test folder and for running the same , ESM module needs to be installed i.e. , use ```"type":"module"``` and use ```npm install esm``` and then ```npm init esm``` to initialise the ESM module environment as well as CommonJS . After doing both, use ```node -r esm owner.js``` to run the program.
- P.S.: The suite.verificationMethod requires did to be resolved to use it as a verification method, this step can be done after finalising the did method. The program provides a basic framework for our implementation.
